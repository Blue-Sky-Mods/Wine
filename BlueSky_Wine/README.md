# Erryial's Wine script

This script was originally created by me for my GTA 5 FiveM server called Blue Sky RP around November 2019. This script draws in inspiration from other scripts such as Kuzkay Coke and from other servers such as Badlands RP.

### Installation

This script is also based on the ESX framework.
You need the script InteractSoundS to have the sound warnings activate.
Finally, you'll need pNotify for some notifications.

Simply put the script in your resource folder, and add the foldername to your script list for your fiveM server.
I will not be providing support for this script in any form.
